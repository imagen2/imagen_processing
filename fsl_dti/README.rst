=======
Diffusion data preprocessed with fsl (deprecated version)
=======
-----------------
Goal:
-----------------
The imagen_diffsl script preprocesses all dti data from the eight IMAGEN centers (http://www.imagen-europe.com). 

-----------------
Configuration:
-----------------

Imagen_diffsl needs FSL>=5.09 to be installed on your system and properly set up (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation).
If the option RESTORE is set to yes, you need the restore.py script, and python>=2.7 and dipy>=0.8 installed.

-----------------
Preprocessing steps:
-----------------
The pipeline consists in the following steps:

1. Linear registration with eddy current correction and bvec rotation using the first volume of the dti data as reference.
2. B0 mapping correction if possible using magnitude and phase images from the fieldmap acquisition. The correction direction is defined automatically (default is y).
3. Brain extraction
4. Tensor computation with weighted least squares and RESTORE (optional, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15844157).

The script takes into account the own characteristics of each imaging center considering the scanner type, the diffusion-weigthed and the B0 fieldmap sequences.

-----------------
Inputs:
-----------------
The general use is:

imagen_diffsl <mag> <phase> <dti> <center> <restore> <pdir>

* mag, the raw magnitude image from the fieldmap.
* phase, the raw phase image from the fieldmap.
* dti,the 4D image including the diffusion weighted images.
* center, the center id between 1 and 8.
* restore=yes or no for the optional RESTORE
* pdir, output directory for preprocessed data

All images must be in ANALYZE, NIFTI or NIFTI.GZ.

For centers concatenating fieldmaps (magnitude and phase images in a 4D image) like Nottingham and Dublin, you may replace the magnitude with NA and the phase with the 4D image:
imagen_diffsl	NA	000038429243s601a1006	000038429243s901a1009 2 yes /tmp/

For Berlin with three dti sets and without fieldmap from the GE scanner, you need to specify only the three dti images (no correction distortion is applied):
Imagen_diffsl	000021053574s006a1001	000021053574s007a1001	000021053574s008a1001	4 yes /tmp/


For Berlin with one dti set and with fieldmaps from the Siemens scanner, you need to specify 41 instead of 4 for the center id:
imagen_diffsl	000014178831s006a1001	000014178831s007a2001	0000014178831s016a1001	41 yes /tmp/

-----------------
Automatic QC:
-----------------
Several automatic QC steps can be performed on these output files:

1. Volumes and slices

QCing the number of volumes and slices.

* File: subject_dtit.slices
* Flag: if # of volumes != 36 or # of slices != 60

2. Slice-dropout

QCing slice by slice for divergent values indicating a signal dropout.

* File: subject_dtit.slices
* Flag: if # > 1

3. Head motion

QCing volume by volume for head rotation based on the matrix used for the spatial registration.

* File: subject_dti_ecc.rotation
* Flag: if # > 1

4. B0 mapping correction

QCing the distortion correction by looking at the cost measure of the spatial registration before and after correction.

* Files: subject_dti_ecc_dc.log
* Flag: if the cost measure is bigger after correction than without correction 

5. Tensor computation

QCing the tensor computation by using a k-means clustering on the global FA, MD, L1, L2, L3 and MO values.

* Files: subject_dti_ecc_brain_tf.log
* Flag: if not in the two main clusters.
